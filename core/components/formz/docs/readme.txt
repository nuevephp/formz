A Form Builder for MODx Revolution.

This Extra allows you to create Forms from a UI that interfaces with FormIt through FormItFastPack. You can store
forms in database and also send forms via email also.

Formz has two dependencies which need to be installed first. The dependencies are both
available through the MODX Package Management tool.

Dependencies as now installed:
	FormIt (v2.2.0-pl)
	FormitFastPack (1.1.0-pl)
