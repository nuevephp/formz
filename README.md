## Installing From Package

If you are installing from the package provided inside the packages directory, just copy the file into your
MODX core/packages directory and then do find file locally inside of your Manager Package Management interface.

Once the package is installed you can setup a template variable and assign the __formz__ input type and output type to it.
Go to a page that has the template variable assigned to its template, and you should now have an empty dropdown menu.

You can now start to create Forms by going to the components menu __Formz Builder__.
